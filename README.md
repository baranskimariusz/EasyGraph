# EasyGraph
An app for quick and simple statistical analysis.
## Introduction
The newest commit introduces the first version of EasyGraph, a simple application for loading and plotting data from XLSX files. The app features a clean graphical user interface built using Tkinter, with buttons for loading data and plotting a chart. 

To load data, users can click the "Load data" button and select a Excel file from their computer. The app uses pandas to read the data from the file and displays it in the console.

To plot a bar chart, users can click the "Plot" button, which generates a simple chart using matplotlib. The chart displays the data loaded from the Excel file in a line chart format.

Future versions of the app may include additional features and functionality, such as the ability to plot different types of charts and customize chart styles.

## Thanks for using EasyGraph!
